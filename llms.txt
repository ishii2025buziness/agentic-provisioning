# Agentic Provisioning

> Self-optimizing provisioning system for GitHub repositories.

## Overview

This skill enables AI agents to:
- Analyze GitHub repositories and extract requirements (language, GPU, memory)
- Search for optimal cloud providers via web search
- Provision environments (Docker/cloud)
- Maintain a knowledge base of successful setups

## Files

- SKILL.md: Main skill definition with step-by-step procedures
- references/ARCHITECTURE.md: System architecture and design principles
- references/PROVIDERS.md: Supported cloud providers
- scripts/: Reference implementations (optional, not required)

## Usage

When user provides a GitHub URL and asks to deploy/run/provision:
1. Read SKILL.md for procedures
2. Follow Step 1-5 to analyze, search, provision, and record

## Key Concepts

- **Lock**: Save successful procedures to knowledge base for reproducibility
- **Search Better**: Search web for improvements before each run
- **Language Independent**: Procedures can be implemented in any language
